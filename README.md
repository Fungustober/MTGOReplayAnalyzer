### Important bits:
You'll either need a relative path (e.g. `name.file` or `folder\name.file`) or an absolute path (e.g. `C:\Users\...`) to the file. 
To make things easier on yourself, put your MTGO GameLog files into the `Program` folder, so you can just copy-paste the filename (with extension) into the console when it runs.
